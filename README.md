# Open Source Projects

## [AgentGPT](https://agentgpt.reworkd.ai/)
A browser-based implementation of AutoGPT, accessible via a no-code platform
<details>

### How it works
- A no-code platform
- Assigning a goal to the agent, witnessing its thinking process, and formulation of an execution plan and taking actions accordingly

### Features
- Uses OpenAI **functions**
- Supports gpt-3.5-16k, pinecone and pg_vector databases

### Links
- [Website](https://agentgpt.reworkd.ai/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT)

### Stack
- Frontend: NextJS + Typescript
- Backend: FastAPI + Python
	- DB: MySQL through docker with the option of running SQLite locally

- [Website](https://gpt3demo.com/apps/ai-legion)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/eumemic/ai-legion)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dysmemic)
</details>



## [AutoGPT](https://autogpt.net/)

<details>

- A lot like BabyAGI combined with LangChain tools.
- Can execute many commands such as Google Search, browse websites, write to files, and execute Python files
- [GitHub](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT)
</details>

## [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi)
<details>


### How it works
- Creates tasks based on the result of previous tasks and a predefined objective.
- The script then uses OpenAI's NLP capabilities to create new tasks based on the objective
- Leverages OpenAI's GPT-4, pinecone vector search, and LangChainAI framework
- Default model is OpenAI GPT3-turbo
- The system maintains a task list for managing and prioritizing tasks
- It autonomously creates new tasks based on completed results and reprioritizes the task list accordingly, showcasing the adaptability of AI-powered language models

</details>


## [BabyCatAGI](https://replit.com/@YoheiNakajima/BabyCatAGI)
BabyCatAGI is a mod of BabyBeeAGI, which is a mod of OG BabyAGI
<details>


### How it works
- Just 300 lines of code
- This was built as a continued iteration on the original BabyAGI code in a lightweight way. Differences to BabyAGI include the following:
	- Task Creation Agent runs once
	- Execution Agent loops through tasks
	- Task dependencies for pulling relevant results
	- Two tools: search_tool and text_completion
	- ‚ÄúMini-agent‚Äù as tool
	- Search tool combines search, scrape, chunking, and extraction.
	- Results combined to create summary_report


### How to use
- Fork this into a private Repl
- Add your OpenAI API Key (required) and SerpAPI Key (optional)
- Update the OBJECTIVE variable
- Press "Run" at the top.

A developer assistant able to make whole nodejs project with unlimited prompts
<details>

### How it works
- Provides a core prompt for building the foundation of your application
- Allows you to add unlimited sections, each of which is a prompt representing a specific part of your app

### Features
- Friday utilizes GPT-4 for AI assistance, but it has been tested and optimized with GPT-4-32k for improved speed and better results.
- It requires 2 small requests for your app's base and 1 request per section you provide.
- Friday employs esbuild behind the scenes for every app created by it.

## [GPT Engineer](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer)
Specify your project, and the AI agent constructs the entire code base.


GPT Engineer is made to be easy to adapt, extend, and make your agent learn how you want your code to look. It generates an entire codebase based on a prompt.
<details>

Model: GPT 4
Specify what you want it to build, the AI asks for clarification, and then builds it.

### Features
- You can specify the "identity" of the AI agent by editing the files in the identity folder.

Editing the identity, and evolving the main_prompt, is currently how you make the agent remember things between projects.

Each step in steps.py will have its communication history with GPT4 stored in the logs folder, and can be rerun with scripts/rerun_edited_message_logs.py.

## [Teenage AGI](https://github.com/seanpixel/Teenage-AGI/blob/main/README.md#experiments)

Can recall infinite memory, THINKS before it speaks, and doesn't lose memory after being shutting down
<details>

### How it works
- Model: GPT-4
- Language: Python
- Uses OpenAI and Pinecone to give memory to an AI agent and also allows it to "think" before making an action (outputting text)
- Also, just by shutting down the AI, it doesn't forget its memories since it lives on Pinecone and its memory_counter saves the index that it's on

**Here is what happens every time the AI is queried by the user:**

- AI vectorizes the query and stores it in a Pinecone Vector Database
- AI looks inside its memory and finds memories and past queries that are relevant to the current query
- AI thinks about what action to take
- AI stores the thought from Step 3
- Based on the thought from Step 3 and relevant memories from Step 2, AI generates an output
- AI stores the current query and its answer in its Pinecone vector database memory
