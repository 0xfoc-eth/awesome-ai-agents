## [AgentGPT](https://agentgpt.reworkd.ai/)
A browser-based implementation of AutoGPT, accessible via a no-code platform
<details>

### How it works
- A no-code platform
- Assigning a goal to the agent, witnessing its thinking process, and formulation of an execution plan and taking actions accordingly

- Uses OpenAI **functions**
- Supports gpt-3.5-16k, pinecone and pg_vector databases

### Links
- [Website](https://agentgpt.reworkd.ai/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/reworkd/AgentGPT)

### Stack
- Frontend: NextJS + Typescript
- Backend: FastAPI + Python
	- DB: MySQL through docker with the option of running SQLite locally

## [Aomni](https://www.aomni.com/)
An AI agent specifically designed for research
<details>

### How it works
- Breaks down a high level research question into a step-by-step plan, and executes it
- Diverse tools, including a full web browser
- Can access internet information without the need for an API
- "We don't generate content using AI, as it can be unreliable. Instead, we extract relevant information from trusted sources, cluster and process it into a user-friendly format."
- AI-powered query planner intelligently routes and executes requests, ensuring correctness and diverse source selection

## [AutoGPT](https://autogpt.net/) 

<details>

- A lot like BabyAGI combined with LangChain tools.
- Can execute many commands such as Google Search, browse websites, write to files, and execute Python files
- [GitHub](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT)
</details>
 
## [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi)
<details>

- Default model is OpenAI GPT3-turbo
- Paper: [Task-driven Autonomous Agent Utilizing GPT-4, Pinecone, and LangChain for Diverse Applications](https://yoheinakajima.com/task-driven-autonomous-agent-utilizing-gpt-4-pinecone-and-langchain-for-diverse-applications/)
- The main idea behind this system is that it creates tasks based on the result of previous tasks and a predefined objective. 
- The script then uses OpenAI's NLP capabilities to create new tasks based on the objective

</details>


## [BabyCatAGI](https://replit.com/@YoheiNakajima/BabyCatAGI)
BabyCatAGI is a mod of BabyBeeAGI, which is a mod of OG BabyAGI. BabyCatAGI is at 300 lines of code.

## [Friday](https://github.com/amirrezasalimi/friday/)
A developer assistant able to make whole nodejs project with unlimited prompts
<details>

### How it works
- Provides a core prompt for building the foundation of your application
- Allows you to add unlimited sections, each of which is a prompt representing a specific part of your app

### Features
- Friday utilizes GPT-4 for AI assistance, but it has been tested and optimized with GPT-4-32k for improved speed and better results.
- It requires 2 small requests for your app's base and 1 request per section you provide.
- Friday employs esbuild behind the scenes for every app created by it.

## [Loop GPT](https://github.com/farizrahman4u/loopgpt/tree/main)
 
 <details>
- Languages: Python
- Default model: GPT-3.5-turbo (also possible with GPT-4)
- Modular Auto-GPT Framework
- Plug N Play" API - Extensible and modular "Pythonic" framework, not just a command line tool
- Easy to add new features, integrations and custom agent capabilities, all from python code, no nasty config files!
- Minimal prompt overhead - Every token counts. We are continuously working on getting the best results with the least possible number of tokens.
- Human in the Loop - Ability to "course correct" agents who go astray via human feedback.
- Full state serialization - can save the complete state of an agent, including memory and the states of its tools to a file or python object. No external databases or vector stores required (but they are still supported)!

## [Teenage AGI](https://github.com/seanpixel/Teenage-AGI/blob/main/README.md#experiments)


<details>

### How it works
- Model: GPT-4
- Language: Python
- Uses OpenAI and Pinecone to give memory to an AI agent and also allows it to "think" before making an action (outputting text)
- Also, just by shutting down the AI, it doesn't forget its memories since it lives on Pinecone and its memory_counter saves the index that it's on

**Here is what happens every time the AI is queried by the user:**

- AI vectorizes the query and stores it in a Pinecone Vector Database
- AI looks inside its memory and finds memories and past queries that are relevant to the current query
- AI thinks about what action to take
- AI stores the thought from Step 3
- Based on the thought from Step 3 and relevant memories from Step 2, AI generates an output
- AI stores the current query and its answer in its Pinecone vector database memory

## [‚ÄúWestworld‚Äù simulation](https://theolvs.github.io/westworld/)
Westworld is a multi-agent simulation library, its goal to simulate and optimize systems and environments with multiple agents interacting.
<details>

- Researchers from Stanford and Google created an interactive sandbox env with 25 Gen AI agents can simulate human behavior
- They walk in the park, join for coffee at a cafe, and share news with colleagues. They demonstrated surprisingly good social
- Westworld's inspiration is drawn from Unity software and Unity ML Agents, adapted in Python


[Underlying paper - Generative Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442)
- A paper simulating interactions between tens of agents
- Presenting an architecture that extends a language model to store and synthesize the agent's experiences, enabling dynamic behavior planning in an interactive sandbox environment with generative agents

</details>


### Links
- [GitHub](https://github.com/TheoLvs/westworld)
- [Documentation](https://theolvs.github.io/westworld/ )

### Languages
- The library is available on PyPi via
pip install westworld
- [Javascript version (being developed)](https://github.com/TheoLvs/westworldjs)

### Current features

- Easy creation of Grid and non-grid environments
- Objects (Agents, Obstacles, Collectibles, Triggers)
- Subclassing of different objects to create custom objects
- Spawner to generate objects randomly in the environment
- Basic rigid body system for all objects
- Simple agent behaviors (pathfinding, wandering, random walk, fleeing, vision range)
- Automatic maze generation
- Layer integration to convert image to obstacle and snap it to a grid
- Sample simulations and sample agents for classic simulations
- Simulation visualization, replay and export (gif or video)
