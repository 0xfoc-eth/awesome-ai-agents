## [AutoGPT](https://autogpt.net/)

<details>

- A lot like BabyAGI combined with LangChain tools.
- Can execute many commands such as Google Search, browse websites, write to files, and execute Python files
- [GitHub](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT)
</details>

## [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi)
<details>


### How it works
- Creates tasks based on the result of previous tasks and a predefined objective.
- The script then uses OpenAI's NLP capabilities to create new tasks based on the objective
- Leverages OpenAI's GPT-4, pinecone vector search, and LangChainAI framework
- Default model is OpenAI GPT3-turbo
- The system maintains a task list for managing and prioritizing tasks
- It autonomously creates new tasks based on completed results and reprioritizes the task list accordingly, showcasing the adaptability of AI-powered language models

## [BabyCatAGI](https://replit.com/@YoheiNakajima/BabyCatAGI)
BabyCatAGI is a mod of BabyBeeAGI, which is a mod of OG BabyAGI
<details>


### How it works
- Just 300 lines of code
- This was built as a continued iteration on the original BabyAGI code in a lightweight way. Differences to BabyAGI include the following:
	- Task Creation Agent runs once
	- Execution Agent loops through tasks
	- Task dependencies for pulling relevant results
	- Two tools: search_tool and text_completion
	- ‚ÄúMini-agent‚Äù as tool
	- Search tool combines search, scrape, chunking, and extraction.
	- Results combined to create summary_report


### How to use
- Fork this into a private Repl
- Add your OpenAI API Key (required) and SerpAPI Key (optional)
- Update the OBJECTIVE variable
- Press "Run" at the top.

## [GPT Engineer](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer)
An AI agent that generates an entire codebase based on a prompt

<details>

### How it works
- Model: GPT 4
- Specify your project, and the AI agent acks for clarification, and then constructs the entire code base

### Features
- Made to be easy to adapt, extend, and make your agent learn how you want your code to look. It generates an entire codebase based on a prompt
- You can specify the "identity" of the AI agent by editing the files in the identity folder
- Editing the identity, and evolving the main_prompt, is currently how you make the agent remember things between projects
- Each step in steps.py will have its communication history with GPT4 stored in the logs folder, and can be rerun with scripts/rerun_edited_message_logs.py

- Streamlined Prompt Design, Publishing & Versioning: Create, edit, test and publish prompts with ease.
- Observability: Access detailed prompt execution history, stats and metrics (duration, prompt cost, completion cost, etc.) for better insights.
- Troubleshooting: Effortlessly resolve issues with your prompts. Time travel to retroactively fine-tune failed prompts and commit the fix instantly.
- Cost Transparency: Gain comprehensive cost transparency across all prompts and AI models.
- Simplified Integration: Reduce code overhead by 90% by consuming your AI prompts using the Pezzo Client, regardless of the model provider.

Not a single agent, but a tool that allows creating agents without coding
<details>
</details>

## [Teenage AGI](https://github.com/seanpixel/Teenage-AGI/blob/main/README.md#experiments)

Can recall infinite memory, THINKS before it speaks, and doesn't lose memory after being shutting down
<details>

### How it works
- Model: GPT-4
- Language: Python
- Uses OpenAI and Pinecone to give memory to an AI agent and also allows it to "think" before making an action (outputting text)
- Also, just by shutting down the AI, it doesn't forget its memories since it lives on Pinecone and its memory_counter saves the index that it's on

**Here is what happens every time the AI is queried by the user:**

- AI vectorizes the query and stores it in a Pinecone Vector Database
- AI looks inside its memory and finds memories and past queries that are relevant to the current query
- AI thinks about what action to take
- AI stores the thought from Step 3
- Based on the thought from Step 3 and relevant memories from Step 2, AI generates an output
- AI stores the current query and its answer in its Pinecone vector database memory
